# Statistical-Analysis
## Overview

The Breast Cancer dataset is loaded and analyzed to provide basic statistics like the average and spread of tumor characteristics. It examines if the average value of a specific feature, such as 'mean radius', deviates from a given value, computes a confidence range for the mean, and explores the relationship between tumor features and their classification as benign or malignant.
